# Bender
 
Bender is a telegram bot developed for literature lovers.
Bender has been developed using Azure services. Thanks to 
Bender, users can search information about a book, open and 
read it using Google Play Books, make a list of "books to 
read", receive everyday news about literature, 
search for libraries in their cities (using a database 
provided by the italian ministry of  culture) and navigate 
there using Google Maps.
Bender uses CosmosDB to store user data, Azure Function and Bing
Search to send every morning news about the literature 
word, LUIS to activate its functionalities based on the 
user messages, Google Maps to reach near libraries and 
Google Books to gain information about books.
